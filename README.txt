README:
This project's goal is to explain how eigenfaces could be used to create a simulated program that automatically matches you with potential Tinder candidates.

NOTE: This project is more for a theoretical use of the mathematical components behind eigenfaces. The author feels that the humor and satirical nature of this topic makes for a more lighthearted approach to a difficult concept.  The satire arises from the author's view of the efficacy and justification of Tinder.

You will need to use images labelled: J1, J2, J3, J4.  (This could be, and should be, extended to more images.)
